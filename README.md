Power BI Dashboard analyzing COVID-19 trends (WIP)
# COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

*Status:* Work in progress (WIP)

## Overview
This project will produce an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze COVID-19 trends (cases, deaths, recoveries) across countries/regions and time. The dashboard will include trend charts, KPIs, and drill-down by country/state.

## What’s included (so far)
- README.md — project plan & status (this file).
- /screenshots — placeholder images / mockups (add screenshots of the dashboard here).
- Project plan & data sources.

## Dataset (examples)
I plan to use public COVID-19 datasets such as Our World in Data or Johns Hopkins CSSE (CSV). Final data source(s) and preprocessing steps will be documented in the repo.

## How to view
- Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop (when uploaded).
- For large PBIX files I will provide a compressed download or GitHub Release.

## Planned features / Next steps
- Data ingestion & cleaning with Power Query.
- Data model: date table, country hierarchy, measures for cases/deaths/recoveries.
- Visuals: time series, rolling averages, heatmap, top countries, growth rate KPI, drill-down.
- Screenshots + short demo GIF.
- Upload .pbix (or provide download link if file > 25MB).

## Notes
*This repo is work-in-progress.* I will update with dataset, PBIX, screenshots and documentation as I complete the dashboard.
